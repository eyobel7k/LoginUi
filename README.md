Login UI
This is a simple login UI that allows users to enter their email and password to log in to a website. It also includes a "forgot password" link and a "sign up" link for users who don't yet have an account.

Technologies Used
This project was built using HTML and CSS. No functionality has been implemented yet, so the login button, forgot password link, and sign up link are currently not functional.

Usage
To use this login UI, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Enter your email and password to log in, or click the "forgot password" or "sign up" links to perform those actions.
